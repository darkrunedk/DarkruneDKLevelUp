## How to install the addon?
All you have to do is:

1. Download the DarkruneDKLevelUp folder to your computer somewhere you can find them.
2. Move the DarkruneDKLevelUp folder into the addons folder (it's inside the WoW folder → Interface → Addons).
3. Start World of Warcraft and click the addon button and see if it shows up. If it does, you have done it correctly.
4. You'r done ☺.
