## How to install the addon?
All you have to do is:

1. Download the files to your computer somewhere you can find them (probably want to make a folder to them called DarkruneDKLevelUp and put them there).

2. Move the following files into the addons folder (normally on Windows it's at C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons).

3. Start World of Warcraft and click the addon button and see if it shows up. If it does, you have done it correctly.

4. Done â˜º.
